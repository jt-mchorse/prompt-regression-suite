"""README banned-phrase lock — sibling to test_architecture_doc.py's
BANNED_PHRASES guard, applied to `README.md` instead of
`docs/architecture.md`.

The architecture-doc lock catches pre-shipping framing leaking into
the architecture doc (see `tests/test_architecture_doc.py` line 63).
The README had the same drift class for four section headers
("Diff layer (#2 · this PR)", "HTML report (#3 · this PR)",
"Regression demo (#4 · this PR)", "CLI: prompt-snap (#5 · this PR)")
— all four are shipped surface per the README's own "Six closed
issues map to today's surface" block. This file locks the README
against that exact drift returning.

Issue #43.

# The pattern uses U+00B7 middle dot + space + "this pr" instead of
# bare "this pr" so we tie the match to the exact section-header
# drift shape ("## Foo (#N · this PR)") and don't false-positive
# on legitimate prose substrings like "this producer", "this
# practice", "this print", etc. Tightened in python-async-llm-
# pipelines#40 (where "backpressure to this producer" forced the
# fix); propagated here for portfolio uniformity.
